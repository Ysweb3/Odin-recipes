    <p>This chopped Greek chicken sandwich makes life easy when you can't decide between a Greek salad and a chicken sandwich. Pile up the components of a salad, chop, mix, and pack them into a sandwich roll, and you will absolutely love the result.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 sandwich roll</li>

        <li>6 ounces cooked chicken</li>
            
        <li>1/4 cup thinly sliced green pepper</li>
            
        <li>4 grape tomatoes, thinly sliced, or more to taste</li>
            
        <li>4 slices English cucumber, or more to taste</li>
            
        <li>6 pitted Greek olives, halved, or more to taste</li>

        <li>3 thin slices red onion, or more to taste</li>
        
        <li>1 cup thickly sliced hearts of Romaine</li>
            
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano, or to taste</li>
            
        <li>1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
            
        <li>1/2 lemon, juiced</li>
            
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut sandwich roll 3/4 of the way in, and if desired, remove some of the crumb from the inside to make more room for filling.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pile up chicken, green pepper, tomatoes, cucumber, olives, and onion. Season with salt, black pepper, cayenne, and oregano, and then use a cleaver or large knife to chop everything into about 1/2-inch pieces.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add Romaine, and chop again until everything into  about 1/4-inch pieces, or as fine as you want.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Top with feta, lemon juice, and olive oil. Perform one last, brief chopping until everything is evenly mixed. Taste and adjust seasoning. Transfer filling into roll, and serve immediately.</li>
